There are two versions of the Driver for this program: OpenDirectory.java that scans the words in text and html files using a BufferedReader and String.split and OpenDirectory1.java that uses Java Streams. You can start from either one of them.

Both drivers count the number of occurrences of "the" in .txt files and the number of occurrences of "href=" in .html or *.htm files. They also write the file paths of all files they visit to output files. Both start with a FileChooser that allows you to pick the starting directory for the search.

Write a new program based on either driver and the iterators provided that asks the user for a search text and then looks for all files that either have that text in the file-name or, if the file is readable, contains that text as in the file. NOTE: ASSUME the search text does NOT contain spaces. LIMIT your readable files to any of the following (*.txt, *.text, *.java, *.c, *.cpp, *.h, *.htm, *.html, *.js, *.hs, *.xml, *.log)
